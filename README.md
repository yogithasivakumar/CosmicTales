# 🌌 Cosmic Tales – Interactive Space Storytelling for Kids

### 🚀 NASA Space Apps Challenge Project

**Cosmic Tales** is an interactive, kid-friendly storytelling web application that helps children understand **space weather** and its impact on Earth in a fun, engaging way.  
It combines **NASA data**, storytelling, and interactive elements to make complex space concepts accessible and exciting for young learners.

---

## ✨ Project Overview

Cosmic Tales features three main characters — **Sunny the Sun 🌞**, **Farmer 👨‍🌾**, and **Pilot ✈️** — each representing a unique connection between space and life on Earth.  
Users can choose a character and explore their 4-page **flipbook story**, with interactive elements like clickable emojis and simple animations.

Each story follows a structure:
1. **Introduction** – Meet the character  
2. **Conflict** – Space weather challenge appears  
3. **Interactive Fun** – User clicks to take action  
4. **Resolution** – Lesson learned about space science  

---

## 🪐 How It Works

1. The user selects a character from the main screen.  
2. The story unfolds as a flipbook with short text and visuals.  
3. Interactive elements (clicks/emojis) trigger simple animations and learning moments.  
4. The user can go back and explore another character’s story.

This storytelling approach transforms **real NASA data** about solar flares, solar winds, and meteor showers into **visual, educational experiences**.
